            <p>Dear Siddhanth,</p>
            <p>As I sit down to write this letter to you, my mind is flooded with memories of our friendship that has stood the test of time and distance. It's incredible to think that we met when we were just 16, two young souls navigating through the complexities of life, and here we are, nearly 20, still as close as ever, if not closer.</p>
            <p>Even though miles apart, our bond remains unbreakable. Distance may physically separate us, but it has only strengthened the connection between our hearts. Isn't it amazing how technology allows us to bridge the gap and keep our friendship alive through texts and calls? Yet, it's not just the means of communication that sustain our friendship; it's the trust, the understanding, and the unwavering support we have for each other.</p>
            <p>I want you to know how much I cherish you and our friendship. You've been there for me through the highs and lows, the laughter and tears, and I am endlessly grateful for your presence in my life. Your friendship has brought so much light and warmth into my world, and I can't imagine navigating this journey without you by my side.</p>
            <p>No matter what the future holds, please know that I will always be here for you. I will stand by you, support you, and cheer you on every step of the way. Your dreams are my dreams, and your struggles are my struggles. Together, we can conquer anything life throws our way.</p>
            <p>As we continue to grow and evolve, may our friendship remain steadfast and enduring. Here's to many more years of laughter, adventures, and shared memories. Thank you for being the incredible friend that you are.</p>
            <p>With Love, Jahnavi</p>
