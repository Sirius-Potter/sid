            <p>Siddhanth,</p>
            <p>As I sit down to type these words, I find solace in the act of writing, for it allows me to express the depths of my feelings without the risk of stumbling over them in conversation. Yet, even as I write, I cannot help but feel a sense of trepidation, for I fear that these words may alter the delicate balance of our friendship. But I cannot keep these sentiments bottled up any longer, for they weigh heavy on my heart like an anchor in the sea of uncertainty.</p>                
            <p>I am drawn to you in ways that transcend the boundaries of mere friendship. I yearn to walk beside you in a romantic embrace, to share moments so sweet they leave us speechless, our laughter echoing in the silence that follows. I want to be more than just a friend; I want to be your confidant, your partner, your companion on this journey called life.</p>
            <p>You are a masterpiece painted by the hands of destiny. Your beauty, both inside and out, leaves me in awe, and I find myself inspired by the strength of your character and the depth of your passion. You possess a magnetism that draws others to you, and I count myself lucky to have been captivated by your presence.</p>
            <p>I confess that these feelings have been swirling within me for some time now, like a tempest raging in the depths of my soul. I have tried to bury them beneath a facade of indifference, but they refuse to be silenced. I don’t care about the past or what our friends might think. When I envision you with someone else, my heart aches with a pain so profound it leaves me breathless. I cannot ignore these emotions any longer; I must lay them bare before you, for they are a testament to the depth of my affection.</p>
            <p>For some reason, there’s nothing in the world I would like to know more except maybe how your hair looks when it’s messy in the morning… I’ll probably never say this out loud and I should probably get some sleep. It’s just that suddenly, Everything that’s significant to you, is significant to me…</p>
            <p>Love isn’t about perfection,Siddhanth, it’s about imperfect people creating their own version of happily ever after. And while idk everything, i do know every version of my happily ever after will always include some version of you.</p>
            <p>I want to be more than just a passing thought in your mind; I want to be your partner in every sense of the word. I want to stand by your side through thick and thin, sharing in the triumphs and tribulations that life inevitably brings. I want to build our future together, one filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities. I wanna be your girlfriend. Obviously, I mean who would not?</p>
            <p>I understand if these words come as a surprise, or even a shock, but please know that they are spoken from the depths of my heart. I do not expect an immediate answer, nor do I wish to pressure you in any way. I only ask that you consider the possibility of us, of what we could be together, and that you follow your heart wherever it may lead.</p>
            <p>With all my Love,</p>
            <p>Jahnavi</p>
